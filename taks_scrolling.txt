Task Scrolling inspired by Completely Fair Scheduler


1)Work Density
	
	dailyRequired = remainingWork/daysRemaining
	if dailyRequired < 1 : Relaxed task
	if dailyRequired = 1 : Perfect time
	if dailyRequired > 1 : Oops it need priority
	
2)Urgency = min(10,dailyRequired*10)
	cap is 10 for max urgency
	if dailyRequired = 0.5 urgency = 5
	
3)Slack = daysRemaining - remainingWork

4)Priority Function
	Score = w1*U + w2*I + w3*C + w4*(10-E) + w5*(10-D)
	where
		U = urgency
		I = Importance
		C = Consequences
		E = effort
		D = difficulty
	All of these will be the inputs provided by the user

5)CFS style penalty
	penalty = alpha / max(1,daysSinceLastScheduled)
	
	this basically prevents 2 tasks appearing as must do
	
6)Critical Condition
	isCritical = remainingWork >= dailyRemaining
	this means if i dont work daily for this i will miss deadline-aware
	
7)Allocation
	for each task
		allocation = min(dailyRequired,remainingCapacity)
	
8)Scheduling
	sum of allocations <= dailyCapacity
